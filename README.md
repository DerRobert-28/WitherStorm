# WitherStorm

* [For feedback and support, feel free to contact me](https://www.youtube.com/@DerRobert28/community).

## Features:

- It makes the Wither look like the Wither Storm in Minecraft Story Mode.

- It also contains the epic Wither Storm music for when the Wither is spawning.

- The resource pack should be compatible to all Minecraft versions containing the Wither.

<br>

## Windows installation using `git`:

```
cd %appdata%\.minecraft\resourcepacks

git clone https://github.com/DerRobert-28/WitherStorm.git
```

<br>

## Linux installation using `git`:

```
cd ~\.minecraft\resourcepacks

git clone https://github.com/DerRobert-28/WitherStorm.git
```

<br>

## Alternative installation:

- [Download the ZIP file of the master branch to your PC](https://github.com/DerRobert-28/WitherStorm/archive/refs/heads/master.zip).

- Copy the folder inside the ZIP file into your `resourcepacks` folder:

  - for Windows: `%appdata%\.minecraft\resourcepacks`

  - for Linux: `~\.minecraft\resourcepacks`

- **IMPORTANT:**

  - If you just copy the ZIP file itself into your `resourcepacks` folder, it will **NOT** work.
  
  - If you extract all files and copy the extracted `resourcepacks` folder, it may also **NOT** work.

<br>

## Please note:

- If you changed the default data path of Minecraft, you need to replace the path above by your custom one.

- If the file `assets/minecraft/sounds/mob/wither/spawn.ogg` file is not cloned into your repository properly, you need to install `git-lfs` first.

  - The actual installation depends on your operating system and your distribution.
  
  - It can be downloaded here: https://git-lfs.com
  
- By using the alternative installation, the file `assets/minecraft/sounds/mob/wither/spawn.ogg` may not be properly installed, due to GitHub's file size reestriction.
