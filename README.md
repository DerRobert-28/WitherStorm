# WitherStorm

Makes the Wither look like the Wither Storm in Minecraft Story Mode.

It also contains the epic music when the Wither is spawning.

The reosource pack should be compatible to all Minecraft versions containing the Wither.

----

## Installation with `git`:

```
cd %appdata%\.minecraft\resourcepacks
git clone https://github.com/DerRobert-28/WitherStorm.git
```

**Please note:**<br>
If you changed the default directory of the Minecraft data,<br>
then you need to replace the path above by the custom one.
