# WitherStorm

Makes the Wither look like the Wither Storm in Minecraft Story Mode.

It also contains the epic music when the Wither is spawning.

The reosource pack should be compatible to all Minecraft versions containing the Wither.

<br>

## Windows installation:

```
cd %appdata%\.minecraft\resourcepacks

git clone https://github.com/DerRobert-28/WitherStorm.git
```

<br>

## Linux installation:

```
cd ~\.minecraft\resourcepacks

git clone https://github.com/DerRobert-28/WitherStorm.git
```

<br>

## Alternative installation:

* Download the ZIP file of the master branch to your PC.
* Copy the folder inside the ZIP file into your Minecraft data folder (see above).
* **IMPORTANT:** If you just copy the ZIP file itself into your Minecraft data folder, it will **NOT** work.

<br>

## Please note:

* If you changed the default data path of Minecraft, you need to replace the path above by your custom one.
* If the file `spawn.ogg` file is not cloned into your repository properly, you need to install `git-lfs` first.<br>
  - The actual installation depends on your operating system and your distribution.
  - It can be downloaded here: https://git-lfs.com
* If you are using the alternative (third) installation, the file `spawn.ogg` may not be properly installed, due to GitHub's file size reestriction.
